Hello!

In this post, we want to share some updates about our Statuspage. Today, we did some enhancements to our statuspage. Our statuspage has been moved out. The previous statuspage was hosted by using [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software/statuspage) service, and now we are using [Instatus](https://instatus.com) service.

Why we use **Instatus** service to host the statuspage?
- We think **Instatus** has more features than the **Atlassian Statuspage**. So, we decide to use **Instatus** to host our statuspage.

How do we access the current statuspage then?
- We've enhanced our statuspage domain. You can access our statuspage with [https://status.hyperfoundation.xyz](https://status.hyperfoundation.xyz) or [https://hyperionfoundation.instatus.com](https://hyperion-foundation.instatus.com). Since the **status.hyperfoundation.xyz** domain is not an actual "domain" of the statuspage website, you will be always directed to **hyperionfoundation.instatus.com** when using the **status.hyperfoundation.xyz** domain.

Is this update permanent? And how about the previous statuspage?
- Yes, we will use [Instatus](https://instatus.com) service from now on. And as for the previous statuspage, the statuspage will be remain available, but there will be no component can be seen. We have put some information on the old statuspage "**About This Site**" section regarding the statuspage update.

And that is the end of this update. Thank you for reading this update, and stay safe. And don't worry, all old statuspage link will be updated with the current statuspage link.
