Hello, Hyperion members and visitors!

Welcome to our blog! The first blog website was suspended because we used a CMS (Content Management System) called [Ghost](https://ghost.org). Ghost CMS requires several components such as a server to host the website and a database server. 

Why we suspend our first blog website? Because we think hosting a blog website with Ghost it's a money consuming.
So, if this type of blog website doesn't suit our needs, we'll continue to use Ghost.

We possibly made this blog website it's because we use [Deno Blog](https://deno.land/x/blog). It's simple and easy to install. And it doesn't need several hardware components, and also we host this website without spending any money.
Deno Blog use [Deno](https://deno.com) (*duh*) as a runtime environment. Deno is more faster and more secure than [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). If you don't know, Ghost CMS using Node.js as a runtime environment and it requires a physical server to run it (read this [forum](https://forum.ghost.org/t/serverless-ghost/6318) to learn more), so Ghost CMS cannot run if you choose to run it on [Serverless](https://www.ibm.com/topics/serverless) computing type.

So, well, this is the end for this post. Thank you for reading this post and we hope you always have a great day.
We'll try to post more on this website if we have something to post.
