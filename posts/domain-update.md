Hello, Hyperion Foundation members and visitors!

In this post, we are going to share about our domain service. The **hyperfoundation.my.id** is no longer available, and that domain has been replaced with the **hyperfoundation.xyz** domain. We always going to use the **hyperfoundation.xyz** domain for all Hyperion Foundation services. If we use another domain name (e.g. **hyperfoundation.my.id**), it means we have several issues with the **hyperfoundation.xyz** domain. We always inform you if we change our domain name. So, please be aware if we make some changes to our services.

That's for today's post (*Yes, this post is very short*). We thank you for taking your time to read this post and we appreciate your effort.
